# Helium Packet Purchaser ![CI](https://github.com/helium/packet-purchaser/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

The Helium Packet Purchaser is an open source module that is designed to relay Helium packets to a Lorawan Network Server via the Semtech UDP protocol. 

The Packet Purchaser includes state channels and communicates with the Helium Blockchain.

Currently the capabilities of the Packet Purchaser are combined with LNS features in the Helium Console/Router. 

We want to enable other LNSâ€™s to take advantage of the coverage our community has built. To see live coverage go here: https://explorer.helium.com/coverage
